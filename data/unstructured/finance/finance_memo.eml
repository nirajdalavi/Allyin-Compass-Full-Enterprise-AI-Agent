Dear Leadership Team,

We are writing to inform you of recent anomalies detected in the transaction patterns of two high-value client accounts located in India — Ankit Verma and Shalini Tope. Both accounts have demonstrated the following red flags over the past 72 hours:
	1.	Multiple high-value withdrawals in rapid succession (4–5 transactions per day).
	2.	Transfers to international accounts flagged by our compliance algorithms.
	3.	Deviation from historical behavior profiles, including activity outside of normal banking hours.
	4.	A sudden reduction in account balances — more than 40% drawdown in both cases.

In addition to these indicators, preliminary checks show that these accounts were accessed from multiple IP addresses across different geographies, which may suggest unauthorized access or compromised credentials.

Recommended Actions:
	•	Temporarily flag the accounts for manual approval on outgoing transfers above $2,000.
	•	Initiate enhanced KYC verification for the concerned customers.
	•	Forward details to the fraud and compliance teams for further investigation.
	•	Alert our India-based relationship managers to coordinate directly with the clients.

We strongly advise taking action before any additional exposure or reputational risk occurs. Please prioritize this matter and let us know once containment protocols have been initiated.

Sincerely,
Risk Monitoring Unit
FinCo Global Risk Division
