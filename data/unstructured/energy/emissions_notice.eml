Dear Compliance Team,

We would like to bring to your immediate attention that the National Environmental Board (NEB) has released new regulatory guidelines regarding industrial CO2 emissions. These guidelines are part of the 2025 Clean Air Framework, and compliance is mandatory for all energy sector facilities nationwide.

Key Requirements:
	â€¢	All registered energy plants must reduce CO2 emissions by at least 15% compared to their 2023 baseline levels.
	â€¢	The deadline for achieving this reduction is December 31, 2025.
	â€¢	Facilities exceeding their allotted cap will be subject to tiered penalties, ranging from monetary fines to potential shutdown notices for non-compliance.

Impacted Facilities:

Based on our internal reporting:
	â€¢	Plant A currently emits 150.5 tons, above the national median.
	â€¢	Plant B exceeds 220 tons and will likely be flagged for early audit.
	â€¢	Plant C, while below the critical threshold, will still need to demonstrate proactive reduction strategies.

Required Next Steps:
	1.	Compliance Audit: All plant managers must submit their emission reduction plans to the compliance team by October 20th, 2024.
	2.	Technology Upgrade: Review feasibility of integrating carbon capture, real-time monitoring, or cleaner fuel transitions.
	3.	Quarterly Reports: Beginning Q1 2025, all plants must submit emissions data validated by third-party assessors.

We strongly recommend forming dedicated regulatory task forces at each plant to streamline implementation. We will also be conducting a compliance readiness webinar on October 5th at 10 AM, where NEB representatives will address key aspects of the new law.

Please prioritize this directive and report any bottlenecks to the Regulatory Affairs team.

Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring EnergyCorp remains a leader in responsible energy production.

Warm regards,
Regulatory Affairs Division
