Dear Operations Team,

We are writing to inform you of a critical delay concerning the CRISPR kits ordered under PO# BTL-3928 on October 1st. The shipment, originally scheduled for delivery on October 5th, has been held at the Mumbai Customs Inspection Hub due to additional verification of bio-sensitive materials.

According to our freight partner (BlueArrow Logistics), customs authorities flagged the package for detailed scrutiny because the CRISPR kits fall under Category 3: Genetic Editing Instruments, requiring manual clearance documentation. This was a recent policy update, and unfortunately, our shipment was one of the first impacted under the new rule.

Updated Timeline:
	•	Inspection Completed: October 7th
	•	Release from Customs: Expected by October 9th (pending clearance certificate)
	•	Estimated Delivery to Lab: October 10th or 11th

Action Items:
	1.	Notify Lab Technicians: All scheduled trials involving CRISPR kits from Oct 6-10 must be postponed. Please ensure affected teams are informed by EOD today.
	2.	Inventory Check: Cross-check available backup kits and notify procurement if alternate sources need to be activated.
	3.	Compliance File: Regulatory Affairs must update Form G-27 to reflect the hold and justification for audit trail.

We understand the criticality of this shipment and have escalated the matter to our logistics coordinator and legal compliance officer. Our priority is to ensure minimal disruption to the scheduled genome editing trials and maintain full compliance with local authorities.

If you have any questions or need to adjust downstream timelines, please reach out directly.

Apologies for the inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation.

Warm regards,
Biotech Logistics Team
