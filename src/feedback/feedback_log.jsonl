{"query": "what was the mail regarding risk for indian customer?", "answer": "The email was regarding an urgent risk alert for two high-value client accounts located in India, specifically belonging to Ankit Verma and Shalini Tope. The risk is due to unusual account activity, including multiple high-value withdrawals, transfers to international accounts, activity outside of normal banking hours, and a sudden reduction in account balances. Additionally, the accounts were accessed from multiple IP addresses across different geographies, which may suggest unauthorized access or compromised credentials. The recommended actions include temporarily flagging the accounts, initiating enhanced KYC verification, forwarding details to the fraud and compliance teams, and alerting the India-based relationship managers to coordinate directly with the clients.", "rating": 1, "domain": "finance", "tool_used": "VectorTool", "timestamp": "2025-05-18T11:03:39", "response_time": 11.14}
