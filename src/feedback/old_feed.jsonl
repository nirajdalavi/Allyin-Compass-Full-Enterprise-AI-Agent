{"query": "what was the mail regarding risk for indian customer?", "answer": "The email regarding risk for Indian customer Ankit Verma and Shalini Tope stated that unusual account activity was detected in their accounts over the past 72 hours, including multiple high-value withdrawals in rapid succession, transfers to international accounts flagged by compliance algorithms, deviation from historical behavior profiles, activity outside of normal banking hours, and a sudden reduction in account balances. Additionally, preliminary checks showed that these accounts were accessed from multiple IP addresses across different geographies, which may suggest unauthorized access or compromised credentials. The recommended actions included temporarily flagging the accounts for manual approval on outgoing transfers above $2,000, initiating enhanced KYC verification for the concerned customers, forwarding details to the fraud and compliance teams for further investigation, and alerting the India-based relationship managers to coordinate directly with the clients.", "rating": 1, "domain": "finance"}
